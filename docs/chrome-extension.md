# Chrome Browser Extension

Wutch requires one pretty technical pointer to operate - a precise handle of an element for the target page. Obtaining it might be a bit tricky, if you don't have a hands-on experience with Web Development. To smoothen the process, we're shipping a [Wutch Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wutch/daepijeddhccepaahegmohekmifhnnfe?hl=en) for Chrome to simplify this procedure.

<div className="pane-info">
All in all, extension's purpose is very simple: capture the page you want to track and the element you'll point on it.
</div>

To provide better transparency, we're distributing this extension as an [Open Source](https://github.com/av/wutch-chrome-extension).
