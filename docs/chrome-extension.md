# Chrome Browser Extension

![Screenshot of Wutch Documentation with active Wutch extension](/images/docs/extension-in-action.png)

Wutch requires one pretty technical pointer to operate - a precise handle of an element for the target page. Because not everybody have hands-on experience with Web Development, we're shipping a [Wutch Browser Extension](https://github.com/av/wutch-chrome-extension) for Chrome to simplify this procedure.

All in all, extension's purpose is very simple: capture the page you want to track and the element you'll point on it.

However, you'll still need to put it right _inside_ of your browser. So, to provide better transparency, we're distributing [this extension](https://github.com/av/wutch-chrome-extension) as an  [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). In addition to transparency, it makes possible for anyone to inspect and verify this extension's source code. So, overall it's easy to ensure that it does only what it's supposed to do and no shady business going on.
