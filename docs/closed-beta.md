# Closed Beta Notes

### Thanks for joining a closed beta of Wutch!

<div className="pane-info">
As Wutch is a product which is being in the development right now, there are a lot of areas which might not work properly or not work at all. There are also multiple implicit limitations which might render the service unavailable or inaccessible for use. Please, don't hesitate to be loud about these. Loud-speaking could be done in any of the <a href="https://wutch.net/docs/support">support channels</a> suitable for you.
