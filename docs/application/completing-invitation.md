# Complete the invitation

To complete the invitation procedure:

- Open your invitation email, it should contain an invitation link
- Proceed with a link, it'll confirm your invitation request in our platform
- After request confirmed, you'll be redirected to a password configuration page

- Choose a secure password and ensure you've got it stored somewhere, as Wutch doesn't yet have a password reset flow available
- After password successfully set, you'll be redirected to a main Wutch dashboard (which will be empty, for now).
