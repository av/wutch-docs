# Getting Started

Welcome to the [Wutch](https://wutch.net) documentation!

Wutch provides you with a service to track any value you can find online. It works just like your browser does, by visiting the pages
you selected on a given schedule and checking if anything changed. Unlike your browser, though, it doesn't require your time to operate. As soon as change is detected, it'll send you a notification over selected notification channel.

If you have questions about Wutch, you're always welcome to reach out to public [Discussions Telegram Channel](https://t.me/wutch_discussions)

To start working with Wutch, you may consider installing our [Browser Extension](https://wutch.net/docs/chrome-extension) and then proceeding with creating your first Wutch.
