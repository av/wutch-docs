# Installing Wutch Extension for Chrome

As for the moment, Wutch Browser extension is not yet available in Chrome Web Store. So the only way to install it is via manual installation.

## Manual Installation

Open Extension's [Releases Page](https://github.com/av/wutch-chrome-extension/releases)

Locate the latest release, at the "Assets" section, there will be a `.zip` archive with packaged extension. Download it.

After downloading, unpack it to a folder on your local machine and proceed to **chrome://extensions** in your Browser's address bar. This will open a special page in Chrome, to manage and control installed extensions.

In order to manually install the extension, you'll need to have the "Developer Mode" toggle being enabled.

After enabling the toggle, you'll see three new controls below it. Click "Load unpacked" and locate the folder you've extracted the archive into. Choose the folder to install the extension.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a new item in your extensions list.

You can also disable and/or remove Wutch extension from the same page once you no longer need it.
