# Installing Wutch Extension for Chrome

As for the moment, Wutch Browser extension is not yet available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). So the only way to install it is via manual installation.

## Manual Installation

To install extension, you'll need to download its sources from GitHub.

### Downloading Extension

Open Extension's [Releases Page](https://github.com/av/wutch-chrome-extension/releases)

Locate the latest release, at the "Assets" section, there will be a `.zip` archive with packaged extension. Download it.

### Unpacking Extension

After downloading, unpack it to a folder on your local machine and proceed to **chrome://extensions** in your Browser's address bar. This will open a special page in Chrome, to manage and control installed extensions.

### Enabling "Developer Mode" for Chrome Extensions

In order to manually install the extension, you'll need to have the "Developer Mode" toggle being enabled.
